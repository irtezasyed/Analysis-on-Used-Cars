Analyzed used cars data from Kaggle using a Jupyter notebook to understand and analyze the factors that contribute to the pricing of a vehicle and to utilize these relevant features to build an efficient model that could effectively predict the pricing of a used vehicle

Performed data cleaning activities using pandas and numpy to prepare the data for analysis.

Created Visualizations using matplotlib to find the root cause of the high prices.

Integrated multiple machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.

Random Forest regression is the best performing model for the dataset compared to other
